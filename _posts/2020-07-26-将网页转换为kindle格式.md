首先需要区分电子书和格式，epub适用于ipad等，mobi适用于kindle..

使用的软件，html转成mobi需要calibre。如果是word，则需要[**Corel WordPerfect X4**](http://www.corel.com/servlet/Satellite/us/en/Product/1207676528492#tabview=tab0)转换成html。也可以直接使用ms word2007，保存为 Filtered, HTML格式。

看英文介绍，直接点击convert book，没有如何创建book的说明。参照https://www.ctolib.com/TruthHun-converter.html学习

卡在 将calibre加入到系统环境变量中。

继续看英文介绍。

在介绍转换软件之后是介绍加入目录 。

然后是设置CSS样式。mobi推荐

body { margin: 0; }
p {margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; padding: 0pt; text-indent: 15pt; text-align: justify;}
h1 { text-align: center; }
h2 {text-align: center; font-size: larger; padding-bottom: 20pt; page-break-before: always;}
h3 { text-align: center; padding-bottom: 20pt; }
h4 { text-align: center; }
h5 { text-align: center; }
h6 { text-align: center; }



## Ebook Formatting Tutorial

The purpose of this tutorial is to teach users how to turn their word document or html file into an epub or mobipocket formatted ebook ready to read on the Amazon Kindle, Iphone/Ipad/Itouch, Nook, the Sony PRS, and other portable devices. 

This tutorial focuses on using Calibre as the conversion tool. 

The tutorial is for users with a **moderate** understanding of HTML and Microsoft Word applications. For the purpose of this guide the RTF format is used because it is not a proprietary format and will open in any Word program. Such as Open Office, Wordpad, Microsoft Office, and etc...

This tutorial will focus on using [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/) to convert documents into ebook format. Please be aware that many of the pages use screencaps.

## Ebook Formats Information Page

The first thing a person should do is figure out what formats their device supports. To find out what file formats your device supports visit the [Ebook Reader Matrix Wiki](http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/E-book_Reader_Matrix). Scroll down until you find your device and look under the row Supported Formats. 

For the purposes of this tutorial I will only focus on converting to epub and mobipocket formats, however please keep in mind that Calibre will also convert to many other file formats that are listed at the [Ebook Reader Matrix Wiki](http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/E-book_Reader_Matrix). 

> **EPUB = Nook, Sony PRS, Ipad, and etc...**
>
> **MOBI/PRC = Amazon Kindle and the Cybook**

For more detailed information please visit Elf's post [Ebook formats](http://ebooks.dreamwidth.org/4408.html). It is currently hosted on the Dreamwidth community called [Ebooks](http://ebooks.dreamwidth.org/). Or you may visit the [Mobile Read Ebook Formats](http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/E-book_formats) wiki post.

## Programs You Will Need 

**Conversion Software** 

[**Calibre**](http://calibre-ebook.com/)

The first program you need to install before continuing and if you don't already have it is [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/). Calibre is a ebook library management software that works on Windows, Linux, and Macs. It also allows users to convert a variety of file formats into epub and mobipocket as well as a host of other file formats. 

**Word to HTML**

In order to convert documents to epub or mobipocket you first need to find a program to convert your document into HTML. This is not as easy as it sounds, many programs add unnecessary code that will make editing the HTML much harder than necessary. It's important to find a good conversion program that fits your needs. 

[**Corel WordPerfect X4**](http://www.corel.com/servlet/Satellite/us/en/Product/1207676528492#tabview=tab0)

This is the program I use to convert all my Word documents and RTF (Rich Text Format) documents to HTML. There is a student version available. What puts this program on the top of my list is that there is a export to Plain HTML option and the program actually means Plain HTML. These html documents are easy to navigate because the program sticks to the basic html codes. 

[**Microsoft Word 2007** ](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word/default.aspx)

If you go with Microsoft Word 2003 or 2007, it is highly recommend you choose the Filtered, HTML option off the drop down list. You may need to find a HTML cleaner to remove the extra code that Microsoft adds to the HTML. [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/) is free and has html tidy which may clear up the code for you to find your chapter headings. 

The main reason I have not dumped MS 2007 is because 2007 has the ability to create Macros which I use to clean up my Word Docs before importing them into [**Corel WordPerfect X4**](http://www.corel.com/servlet/Satellite/us/en/Product/1207676528492#tabview=tab0) and exporting to HTML. [Clean Up Your RTF](https://amalthia.mediawood.net/tutorials/ebooks/cleanup.html) has more information on what is needed to fix your RTF file before converting to HTML. 

 Adding Images

**Cover Images** 

There are three methods of inserting a cover image onto your novel or document. Two are through [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/) and the other is directly through the HTML source code. However, only method 1 and 2 will show the covers on other device libraries or programs. Method 3 will display the cover when you open the ebook but no where else. 

**Method 1** - **Convert E-books Button**

When you hit the convert e-books button this dialogue box will open. In the Book Cover section you click on the button that is highlighted in the photo below. 

![img](https://amalthia.mediawood.net/tutorials/ebooks/Cover%20Image1.JPG)

**Method 2 - Through the Edit Metadata Button** 

When you hit the edit metadata button in Calibre a box will open and it allows users to enter the ISBN number of the novel which will search automatically for a cover, or a user may manual select their own cover much the same way as method 1. 

See picture below. 

![img](https://amalthia.mediawood.net/tutorials/ebooks/Cover%20Image2.JPG)

**Method 3 - Manually insert HTML code into source code document.** 

> <div style="text-align:center"> <img src="url to image goes here.jpg"> </div> 

**Inserting Illustrations and Images in the body of the story:** 

You technically only need to use this code to insert an image: 

> <img src="example.jpg">

However, if you'd like to insert and center the image this is the code that works in epub and mobipocket: 

> <div style="text-align:center"> <img src="example.jpg"> </div>

For some reason <center> does not work on images in epub. Neither does the override code: img {text-align: center;}

You can also set the width and height of the image. 

> <div style="text-align:center"> <img src="example.jpg" width="400" height="200"> </div>

If you want your image to start on a fresh page this is the code I manually insert before the image. 

> <p style="page-break-after:always">&nbsp;</p>

One thing to keep in mind if you plan on having illustrations within the body of your converted story is that it's a good idea to have all the images and the HTML file in one folder before you upload to Calibre.

## Creating a Table of Contents

**Inline Table of Contents (TOC)**

Inline TOC's are where the chapters are directly listed on the HTML file at the beginning of the story. 

**Table of Contents**

Chapter 1

Chapter 2

Chapter 3 

If the inline table of contents was created correctly users can highlight and jump to the listed chapter. In order to insert a table of contents within the html source file users will have to create jump links and an anchor. 

<p><a href="#chapter1">Chapter 1</a></p> (this goes at the top of your file where you are listing your TOC)

<a name="chapter1">Chapter 1</a> is the anchor. 

You will need both elements inserted into your HTML source file for your inline TOC to work. Calibre should automatically detect the chapters and add them to the device's TOC. 

This method will also add the listed Chapters to the device's TOC. 

Here is an example of how the inline TOC looks like via [Calibre Ebook Viewer](http://calibre-ebook.com/). The TOC on the main big frame is what will show up within the story, the other TOC in the narrow sidebar TOC box is what will show up on the device TOC. It is always a good idea to check your document after conversion to make sure your TOC came out the way you expected. 

![img](https://amalthia.mediawood.net/tutorials/ebooks/TOC%20testing.JPG)

The main disadvantage of using inline TOC is that many e-ink devices require a person to scroll through each Chapter one at a time. There is no way to start in the middle and work your way up or down the list. If the story has more than six chapters the inline TOC becomes less useful and a big waste of time and batteries. The faster method to navigate through 30 plus chapters is to access the device's TOC and navigate to the needed chapter via that method. 

Now let's say you don't want to use up 2-3 pages for stories with over 40 chapters but you'd still like a TOC. The next section will explain how to create this effect. 

**Device Table of Contents Only**

This type of Table of Contents is accessible via the menu on the ebook device, it will not insert the table of contents into the body of the document. You may use various computer software epub viewers to see the table of contents. 

In your HTML source file you need to tag your chapters with <h2> or <h3>, for the sake of this tutorial <h2> is used for the following examples. 

The next step is to tell [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/) to search for that tag and add it to the TOC. 

There are two ways to set your TOC preferences in [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/). 

One is to use the convert story option, like in the following screencap.

![img](https://amalthia.mediawood.net/tutorials/ebooks/convert.JPG)

When you click on that button a window will open on the Metadata. If you click the icon in the sidebar that says Table of Contents you'll get this menu and options. 

![img](https://amalthia.mediawood.net/tutorials/ebooks/TOC_convert.JPG)

In this screencap example //h:h2 is the expression used to tell Calibre to find all <h2> tags and add those to the TOC. 

The Preferences menu offers another way to set your TOC preferences for all stories you convert. 

![img](https://amalthia.mediawood.net/tutorials/ebooks/TOC.JPG)

TOC are a great way to navigate long documents and users do appreciate them. 

 

## Look and Feel - CSS

[HTML Cheatsheet](https://amalthia.mediawood.net/tutorials/ebooks/look.html#cheatsheet)

The Look and Feel section of [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/) is where you select the output format, font size, enter any extra CSS code, and etc.

Most of the settings in the Look and Feel section can be set in the main Preferenances, or they can be set on an individual basis. 

![img](https://amalthia.mediawood.net/tutorials/ebooks/Look%20and%20Feel.JPG)

 

Some basic knowledge of CSS is helpful if you plan on using the Extra CSS box. However, if you are unfamilar with css here are the basics codes I use and what each one does. 

body { margin: 0; }
p {margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; padding: 0pt; text-indent: 15pt; text-align: justify;}
h1 { text-align: center; }
h2 {text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: x-large; padding-bottom: 20pt; page-break-before: always;}
h3 { text-align: center; padding-bottom: 20pt; font-weight: 600; font-size: xx-large }
h4 { text-align: center; }
h5 { text-align: center; }
h6 { text-align: center; }
img {text-align: center;} 

body = <body> = this is where I set my body margin so on the device I don't have any margins. 

p = <p> = paragraph tag. This is probably the most important tag if you want to specify how you want your paragraphs to look like. I always indent my paragraphs and remove any extra line space between them because it requires less pages on the device to flip through so the battery will last longer.

I have mine set to remove any margins before and after, no extra padding, a specific text-indent, and to always justify the text. The more css you know the more you can do with your paragraphs. However, since I'm mostly formatting for fiction reading I've kept it simple. 

h2 = <h2> = Heading 2 - this is where I specify how I want my headers to look like. I do like my chapters to start on a fresh page so I added this code page-break-before: always; another important code is the padding-bottom: 20pt which adds some space after the Header. You can also adjust the font size and alignment. 

Another code that I find useful is the **page-break-before: always;** this code forces a page break before each chapter heading so that the chapter header starts on a new page. It's not necessary, however it's aesthetically pleasing so I add it to my <h2> css code.

h3 = <h3> = Heading 3 - I use this for my Title and Author on the front page. 

img = <img src=""> = Images and illustrations. This tag will only work for mobipocket to center your images.

The Extra CSS box is where you would add your embed font code if you had plans to embed fonts. (something I have not tested yet so cannot provide details on how it is done personally) 

**Tip:** do not add page-break-before: always on multiple headers if you plan on using two headers on one page. 

### HTML Cheatsheet

(I keep all these codes on a notepad so when I'm formatting I can refer back to it) 

**Insert a pagebreak into your document not just at chapter headers.** 

> <p style="page-break-after:always">&nbsp;</p>

**Prevent a Paragraph Indent**

> <p style="text-indent: 0pt"> </p> 

**Add a space between paragraphs**

> <p>&nbsp;</p>

**Center your images**

> <div style="text-align:center"> <img> </div>

**LRF/MOBI - Look and Feed CSS** 

> body { margin: 0; }
> p {margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; padding: 0pt; text-indent: 15pt; text-align: justify;}
> h1 { text-align: center; }
> h2 {text-align: center; font-size: larger; padding-bottom: 20pt; page-break-before: always;}
> h3 { text-align: center; padding-bottom: 20pt; }
> h4 { text-align: center; }
> h5 { text-align: center; }
> h6 { text-align: center; }

**EPUB - Look and Feel CSS**

> body { margin: 0; }
> p {margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; padding: 0pt; text-indent: 15pt; text-align: justify;}
> h1 { text-align: center; }
> h2 {text-align: center; font-weight: 600; font-size: x-large; padding-bottom: 20pt; page-break-before: always;}
> h3 { text-align: center; padding-bottom: 20pt; font-weight: 600; font-size: xx-large }
> h4 { text-align: center; }
> h5 { text-align: center; }
> h6 { text-align: center; }

**HR elements** (I do not use this one often. I normally use *** as a section seperator) 

> hr { 
> width: 20%; 
> text-align: center;
> padding-top: 2px;
> padding-bottom: 2px;
> border: 1px solid black; 
> background-color: black; 
> margin-left: 40%;
> } 

### Setting up Calibre for Conversion of HTML files

The first thing you'll need to do it enter your settings for Look & Feel.  先进conversion，再进Common options。再选择Look & feel。

![img](https://amalthia.mediawood.net/tutorials/ebooks/Look%20and%20Feel%20Preferences.JPG)

Second is your Page Setup. This is where you select your device and set your page margins. 

![img](https://amalthia.mediawood.net/tutorials/ebooks/Page%20Setup.JPG)

Third is Structure Detection which is where you enter your Table of Contents settings.

![img](https://amalthia.mediawood.net/tutorials/ebooks/TOC.JPG)

 

### Preparing HTML for Conversion

Once you have your settings in place it's time to prepare your HTML file to convert to Epub or Mobipocket format. 

The cleaner your HTML is the easier it'll be to convert your document and experience fewer problems. 

After you have [cleaned your Word Doc or RTF](https://amalthia.mediawood.net/tutorials/ebooks/cleanup.html) and you convert the file to HTML it is time to open your HTML in Wordpad or Notepad++ or Notepad, basically you'll need to use one of these programs to view the source code of your HTML document. 

I prefer Wordpad to edit my HTML code so that's what I'm using in this tutorial. 

Right click on the document and choose which program to open it in and select Wordpad. 

Once your HTML file is opened it is time to add your chapter tags <h2> to everything you'd like added to your Table of Contents. 

> <h2>Chapter One</h2> 
>
> <h2>Author Notes:</h2> 
>
> and etc... 

Calibre can detect and add those tagged chapters to the Table of Contents if you have gone through the steps and added //h:h2 to your chapter detection. 

This is also when you would want to check to make sure your images embedded correctly. 

If you plan on centering the images add this code you'll have to use. Epub won't recognize any other css code. 

> <div style="text-align:center"> <img> </div>

If your doc/rtf file was well made then you won't have to go through and search for <br> tags and replace those with <p>. Calibre automatically indents <p> tags. It does not indent <br>. Having said that it does not hurt to check for stray <br> tags or to clear out any other code that isn't <em>, <I>, <strong>, <b>, <p>, and ect...

Something to watch out for if you have multiple paragraphs using <strong> or <em> make sure the beginning of the paragraph starts with your <em> or <strong> tag. In web browsers if you forget to close a <em> tag all the rest of the text in the browser will remain <em> until it hits a closing </em> tag. That is not the case in Calibre. Calibre counts </p> as a closing tag for all formatting. Check to make sure your doc to html converting is adding your bold and italics tags at the beginning of your paragraphs. 

Each conversion program has it's own coding that it adds and I use [Microsoft Word Macros](https://amalthia.mediawood.net/tutorials/ebooks/cleanup.html#macros) to fix/clean the HTML or to code my Chapter Headers with <h2>. 

It is worth the time to explore Microsoft Word 2007 and learn how to create your own [macros](https://amalthia.mediawood.net/tutorials/ebooks/cleanup.html#macros). 

Once your HTML is ready, add it to Calibre. 

Then highlight the story and click the button Convert E-Books: 

![img](https://amalthia.mediawood.net/tutorials/ebooks/convert.JPG)

 

You'll get a box like this and this is where you'd add the author name, title, novel summary, book cover, and etc... 

![img](https://amalthia.mediawood.net/tutorials/ebooks/Cover%20Image1.JPG)

After this go to Look and Feel:

![img](https://amalthia.mediawood.net/tutorials/ebooks/Look%20and%20Feel.JPG)

This is where you can modify your Extra CSS or font size. Once you hit OK Calibre will convert your ebook for you. 

From there you can download or transfer the file to your device. 

I normally open it in Calibre Viewer to check my Table of Contents and scan through the ebook for obvious errors like from page 20-100 all the paragraphs are centered. If your HTML source file has an unenclosed center tag that would mess up the text. Or if your header tag isn't closed properly all the paragraphs afterwards will stay bolded.
