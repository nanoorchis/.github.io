# calibre 用户手册

calibre is an e-book library manager. calibre是一个电子书库管理软件。It can view, convert and catalog e-books in most of the major e-book formats.它可以查看、转换和管理大多数主要的电子书格式。It can also talk to many e-book reader devices. 它也可以连接大多数电子阅读设备。It can go out to the Internet and fetch metadata for your books. 它可以联网抓取你的电子书籍的元数据。It can download newspapers and convert them into e-books for convenient reading. 它可以下载新闻并转换成电子书便于阅读。It is cross platform, running on Linux, Windows and macOS.它可以运行在Linus、Windows、macOs多个操作系统平台上。

You’ve just started calibre. What do you do now? Before calibre can do anything with your e-books, it first has to know about them. 在calibre处理你的电子书之前得上calibre知道你的书籍们。Drag and drop a few e-book files into calibre, or click the “Add books” button and browse for the e-books you want to work with. 可以先将一些书通过拖曳或者添加书籍按键来浏览你想处理的书籍。Once you’ve added the books, they will show up in the main view looking something like this:一旦添加书籍后，会显示在像下面一样的主视图中：

![_images/added_books.png](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/_images/added_books.png)

Once you’ve admired the list of books you just added to your heart’s content, you’ll probably want to read one. 当你看到添加的书籍列表时，可能想立即打开它们。In order to do that you’ll have to convert the book to a format your reader understands. 在阅读前需要将书籍转换成你的电子阅读器支持的格式。When first running calibre, the Welcome wizard starts and will set up calibre for your reader device. 第一次启动calibre时，欢迎向导会指引你设置来支持你的电子阅读器。Conversion is a breeze. 转换非常方便。Just select the book you want to convert then click the “Convert books” button. 只需选中书籍，然后单击转换按键。Ignore all the options for now and click “OK”.忽略所有的选项，单击OK。 The little icon in the bottom right corner will start spinning. 右下角的图标开始转圈。Once it’s finished spinning, your converted book is ready. 停止转圈的时候，转换完成。Click the “View” button to read the book.单击View按钮来阅读电子书。

If you want to read the book on your reader, connect it to the computer, wait till calibre detects it (10-20 seconds) and then click the “Send to device” button. 如果想在电子阅读器上阅读，将它连到电脑上，等待calibre识别阅读器，一般10到20秒，然后单击Send to device按键。Once the icon stops spinning again, disconnect your reader and read away! 当右下角图标停止转圈时，断开你的阅读器，开始阅读。If you didn’t convert the book in the previous step, calibre will auto convert it to the format your reader device understands.如果你事先没有转换电子书的格式，calibre会自动将电子书转成的你的阅读器可以识别的格式。

# The Graphical User Interface图形用户界面

https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/gui.html

The Graphical User Interface *(GUI)* provides access to all library management and e-book format conversion features. 图形界面提供全部的书库管理和电子书格式转换功能。The basic workflow for using calibre is to first add books to the library from your hard disk. 最常见的使用calibre的工作流程是从硬盘添加电子书。calibre will automatically try to read metadata from the books and add them to its internal database. calibre自动读取电子书的元数据并添加到内部数据库。Once they are in the database, you can perform various [Actions](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/gui.html#actions) on them that include conversion from one format to another, transfer to the reading device, viewing on your computer, and editing metadata. 添加到数据库中后，可以对电子书进行很多操作，包括格式转换，传输到电子阅读器，在电脑上浏览，编辑元数据等。The latter includes modifying the cover, description, and tags among other details. 也包括调整封面、描述、标签等信息。Note that calibre creates copies of the files you add to it. Your original files are left untouched.在添加书籍过程中，calibre创建了电子书的副本，原始文件不会发生改变。

The interface is divided into various sections:界面分为不同的部分：

- [Actions](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/gui.html#actions)

### [Add books](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/gui.html#id34) 添加书籍

![adbi](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/_images/add_books.png)

The Add books action has seven variations accessed by doing a right-click on the button.添加书籍按钮有七种不同的方式，单击按键右侧的下三角获得。

> 1. **Add books from a single directory**: 从某个目录中添加书籍：Opens a file chooser dialog and allows you to specify which books in a directory should be added. 打开一个文件选择对话框来让你选择目录中的哪些书籍可以 打开。This action is *context sensitive*, 这个操作是上下文敏感的，i.e. it depends on which [catalog](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/gui.html#catalogs) you have selected.取决于你选择的位置。 If you have selected the Library, books will be added to the library.如果你选择了库，书籍会被添加到库中。 If you have selected the e-book reader device, the books will be uploaded to the device, and so on.如果选择了电子阅读器，书籍会被添加到阅读器中。
> 2. **Add books from directories and sub-directories**: 从文件夹和子文件夹中添加书籍。Allows you to choose a directory. The directory and all its sub-directories are scanned recursively, and any e-books found are added to the library. You can choose whether to have calibre add all files present in a single directory to a single book record or multiple book records. calibre assumes that each directory contains a single book. All e-book files in a directory are assumed to be the same book in different formats. This action is the inverse of the [Save to disk](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/gui.html#save-to-disk-multiple) action, i.e. you can Save to disk, delete the books and re-add them in single book per directory mode, with no lost information except for the date (this assumes you have not changed any of the setting for the Save to disk action).
> 3. **Add multiple books from archive (ZIP/RAR)**: 从压缩文件中添加书籍。Allows you to add multiple e-books that are stored inside the selected ZIP or RAR files. It is a convenient shortcut that avoids having to first unzip the archive and then add the books via one of the above two options.
> 4. **Add empty book (Book Entry with no formats)**: 添加空书籍Allows you to create a blank book record. This can be used to then manually fill out the information about a book that you may not have yet in your collection.
> 5. **Add from ISBN**: 通过ISBN号添加。Allows you to add one or more books by entering their ISBNs.
> 6. **Add files to selected book records**: 添加书籍到指定的书籍记录。Allows you to add or update the files associated with an existing book in your library.
> 7. **Add an empty file to selected book records**: 添加空文件到指定的记录。Allows you to add an empty file of the specified format to the selected book records.

The Add books action can read metadata from a wide variety of e-book formats. 添加书籍操作可以识别许多电子书格式的元数据。In addition, it tries to guess metadata from the filename. 同时，它也会尝试通过名称去推测元数据。See the [Guessing metadata from file names](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/gui.html#config-filename-metadata) section, to learn how to configure this.参见 部分，了解如何配置该项功能。

To add an additional format for an existing book you can do any of three things:为已经存在的书籍添加一种额外的格式，可以通过下列三种方式：

> 1. Drag and drop the file onto the Book details panel on the right side of the main window将文件拖到主界面右侧的书籍详情面板
> 2. Right click the Add books button and choose Add files to selected books.右键添加书籍按钮选择添加文件到指定书籍。
> 3. Click the Add books button in the top right area of the Edit metadata dialog, accessed by the [Edit metadata](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/gui.html#edit-meta-information) action.单击编辑元数据窗口右上角的添加书籍按钮。

对于自己来说，添加书籍分两路情况，一种是添加新的书籍。另一种是添加某种格式的文件到已存在的书籍。

### [ Edit metadata](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/gui.html#id35)编辑元数据

![emii](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/_images/edit_meta_information.png)The Edit metadata action has four variations which can be accessed by doing a right-click on the button.编辑元数据有四种选项。

> 1. **Edit metadata individually**: 一个一个的编辑元数据Allows you to edit the metadata of books one-by-one with the option of fetching metadata, including covers, from the Internet. It also allows you to add or remove particular e-book formats from a book.
> 2. **Edit metadata in bulk**: 批量编辑元数据Allows you to edit common metadata fields for large numbers of books simultaneously. It operates on all the books you have selected in the [Library view](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/gui.html#search-sort).
> 3. **Download metadata and covers**:下载元数据和封面 Downloads metadata and covers (if available) for the books that are selected in the book list.
> 4. **Merge book records**: 合并书籍记录Gives you the capability of merging the metadata and formats of two or more book records. You can choose to either delete or keep the records that were not clicked first.

For more details see [Editing e-book metadata](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/metadata.html#metadata).

### [ Convert books](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/gui.html#id36)转换书籍

![cei](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/_images/convert_ebooks.png)E-books can be converted from a number of formats into whatever format your e-book reader prefers. Many e-books available for purchase will be protected by [Digital Rights Management](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/drm.html) *(DRM)* technology. calibre will not convert these e-books. It is easy to remove the DRM from many formats, but as this may be illegal, you will have to find tools to liberate your books yourself and then use calibre to convert them.

For most people, conversion should be a simple one-click affair. If you want to learn more about the conversion process, see [E-book conversion](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/conversion.html#conversion).

The Convert books action has three variations, accessed by doing a right-click on the button.

> 1. **Convert individually**: Allows you to specify conversion options to customize the conversion of each selected e-book.
> 2. **Bulk convert**: Allows you to specify options only once to convert a number of e-books in bulk.
> 3. **Create a catalog of the books in your calibre library**: Allows you to generate a complete listing of the books in your library, including all metadata, in several formats such as XML, CSV, BiBTeX, EPUB and MOBI. The catalog will contain all the books currently showing in the library view. This allows you to use the search features to limit the books to be catalogued. In addition, if you select multiple books using the mouse, only those books will be added to the catalog. If you generate the catalog in an e-book format such as EPUB, MOBI or AZW3, the next time you connect your e-book reader the catalog will be automatically sent to the device. For more information on how catalogs work, read the [Creating AZW3 • EPUB • MOBI catalogs](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/catalogs.html#catalog-tut).



### [View](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/gui.html#id37)

![vi](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/_images/view.png)The View action displays the book in an e-book viewer program. calibre has a built-in viewer for many e-book formats. For other formats it uses the default operating system application. You can configure which formats should open with the internal viewer via Preferences → Interface → Behavior. If a book has more than one format, you can view a particular format by doing a right-click on the button.



### [Send to device](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/gui.html#id38)

![stdi](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/_images/send_to_device.png)The Send to device action has eight variations, accessed by doing a right-click on the button.

> 1. **Send to main memory**: The selected books are transferred to the main memory of the e-book reader.
> 2. **Send to card (A)**: The selected books are transferred to the storage card (A) on the e-book reader.
> 3. **Send to card (B)**: The selected books are transferred to the storage card (B) on the e-book reader.
> 4. **Send specific format to**: The selected books are transferred to the selected storage location on the device, in the format that you specify.
> 5. **Eject device**: Detaches the device from calibre.
> 6. **Set default send to device action**: Allows you to specify which of the options, 1 through 5 above or 7 below, will be the default action when you click the main button.
> 7. **Send and delete from library**: The selected books are transferred to the selected storage location on the device and then **deleted** from the Library.
> 8. **Fetch Annotations (experimental)**: Transfers annotations you may have made on an e-book on your device to the comments metadata of the book in the calibre library.

You can control the file name and folder structure of files sent to the device by setting up a template in Preferences → Import/export → Sending books to devices. Also see [The calibre template language](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/template_lang.html#templatelangcalibre).



### [Fetch news](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/gui.html#id39)

![fni](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/_images/fetch_news.png)The Fetch news action downloads news from various websites and converts it into an e-book that can be read on your e-book reader. Normally, the newly created e-book is added to your e-book library, but if an e-book reader is connected at the time the download finishes, the news is also uploaded to the reader automatically.

The Fetch news action uses simple recipes (10-15 lines of code) for each news site. To learn how to create recipes for your own news sources, see [Adding your favorite news website](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/news.html#news).

The Fetch news action has three variations, accessed by doing a right-click on the button.

> 1. **Schedule news download**: Allows you to schedule the download of your selected news sources from a list of hundreds available. Scheduling can be set individually for each news source you select and the scheduling is flexible allowing you to select specific days of the week or a frequency of days between downloads.
> 2. **Add a custom news source**: Allows you to create a simple recipe for downloading news from a custom news site that you wish to access. Creating the recipe can be as simple as specifying an RSS news feed URL, or you can be more prescriptive by creating Python-based code for the task. For more information see [Adding your favorite news website](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/news.html#news).
> 3. **Download all scheduled news sources**: Causes calibre to immediately begin downloading all news sources that you have scheduled.



### [Library](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/gui.html#id40)

![lii](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/_images/library.png)The Library action allows you to create, switch between, rename or remove a Library. calibre allows you to create as many libraries as you wish. You could, for instance, create a fiction library, a non-fiction library, a foreign language library, a project library, or any structure that suits your needs. Libraries are the highest organizational structure within calibre. Each library has its own set of books, tags, categories and base storage location.

> 1. **Switch/create library…**: Allows you to; a) connect to a pre-existing calibre library at another location, b) create an empty library at a new location or, c) move the current library to a newly specified location.
> 2. **Quick switch**: Allows you to switch between libraries that have been registered or created within calibre.
> 3. **Rename library**: Allows you to rename a Library.
> 4. **Pick a random book**: Chooses a random book in the library for you
> 5. **Remove library**: Allows you to unregister a library from calibre.
> 6. **Export/import all calibre data**: Allows you to either export calibre data for migration to a new computer or import previously exported data.
> 7. ****: Actions 7, 8 etc… give you immediate switch access between multiple libraries that you have created or attached to. This list contains only the 5 most frequently used libraries. For the complete list, use the Quick Switch menu.
> 8. **Library maintenance**: Allows you to check the current library for data consistency issues and restore the current library’s database from backups.

Note

Metadata about your e-books, e.g. title, author, and tags, is stored in a single file in your calibre library folder called metadata.db. If this file gets corrupted (a very rare event), you can lose the metadata. Fortunately, calibre automatically backs up the metadata for every individual book in the book’s folder as an OPF file. By using the Restore database action under Library Maintenance described above, you can have calibre rebuild the metadata.db file from the individual OPF files for you.

You can copy or move books between different libraries (once you have more than one library setup) by right clicking on the book and selecting the action Copy to library.



### [Device](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/gui.html#id41)

![dvi](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/_images/device.png)The Device action allows you to view the books in the main memory or storage cards of your device, or to eject the device (detach it from calibre). This icon shows up automatically on the main calibre toolbar when you connect a supported device. You can click on it to see the books on your device. You can also drag and drop books from your calibre library onto the icon to transfer them to your device. Conversely, you can drag and drop books from your device onto the library icon on the toolbar to transfer books from your device to the calibre library.



### [Save to disk](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/gui.html#id42)

![svdi](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/_images/save_to_disk.png)The Save to disk action has five variations, accessed by doing a right-click on the button.

> 1. **Save to disk**: Saves the selected books to disk organized in directories. The directory structure looks like:
>
>    ```
>    Author_(sort)
>        Title
>            Book Files
>    ```
>
> You can control the file name and folder structure of files saved to disk by setting up a template in Preferences → Import/export → Saving books to disk. Also see [The calibre template language](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/template_lang.html#templatelangcalibre).

> 1. **Save to disk in a single directory**: Saves the selected books to disk in a single directory.
>
> For 1. and 2., all available formats, as well as metadata, are stored to disk for each selected book. Metadata is stored in an OPF file. Saved books can be re-imported to the library without any loss of information by using the [Add books](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/gui.html#add-books) action.
>
> 1. **Save only \*\* format to disk**: Saves the selected books to disk in the directory structure as shown in (1.) but only in your preferred e-book format. You can set your preferred format in Preferences → Interface → Behaviour → Preferred output format
> 2. **Save only \*\* format to disk in a single directory**: Saves the selected books to disk in a single directory but only in your preferred e-book format. You can set your preferred format in Preferences → Interface → Behaviour → Preferred output format
> 3. **Save single format to disk…**: Saves the selected books to disk in the directory structure as shown in (1.) but only in the format you select from the pop-out list.



### [Connect/share](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/gui.html#id43)

![csi](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/_images/connect_share.png)The Connect/share action allows you to manually connect to a device or folder on your computer. It also allows you to set up your calibre library for access via a web browser or email.

> The Connect/share action has four variations, accessed by doing a right-click on the button.
>
> 1. **Connect to folder**: Allows you to connect to any folder on your computer as though it were a device and use all the facilities calibre has for devices with that folder. Useful if your device cannot be supported by calibre but is available as a USB disk.
> 2. **Start Content server**: Starts calibre’s built-in web server. When started, your calibre library will be accessible via a web browser from the Internet (if you choose). You can configure how the web server is accessed by setting preferences at Preferences → Sharing → Sharing over the net
> 3. **Setup email based sharing of books**: Allows sharing of books and news feeds by email. After setting up email addresses for this option, calibre will send news updates and book updates to the entered email addresses. You can configure how calibre sends email by setting preferences at Preferences → Sharing → Sharing books by email. Once you have set up one or more email addresses, this menu entry will be replaced by menu entries to send books to the configured email addresses.



### [Remove books](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/gui.html#id44)

![rbi](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/_images/remove_books.png)The Remove books action **deletes books permanently**, so use it with care. It is *context sensitive*, i.e. it depends on which [catalog](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/gui.html#catalogs) you have selected. If you have selected the Library, books will be removed from the library. If you have selected the e-book reader device, books will be removed from the device. To remove only a particular format for a given book use the [Edit metadata](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/gui.html#edit-meta-information) action. Remove books also has five variations which can be accessed by doing a right-click on the button.

> 1. **Remove selected books**: Allows you to **permanently** remove all books that are selected in the book list.
> 2. **Remove files of a specific format from selected books…**: Allows you to **permanently** remove e-book files of a specified format from books that are selected in the book list.
> 3. **Remove all formats from selected books, except…**: Allows you to **permanently** remove e-book files of any format except a specified format from books that are selected in the book list.
> 4. **Remove all formats from selected books**: Allows you to **permanently**remove all e-book files from books that are selected in the book list. Only the metadata will remain.
> 5. **Remove covers from selected books**: Allows you to **permanently** remove cover image files from books that are selected in the book list.
> 6. **Remove matching books from device**: Allows you to remove e-book files from a connected device that match the books that are selected in the book list.

Note

Note that when you use Remove books to delete books from your calibre library, the book record is permanently deleted, but on Windows and macOS the files are placed into the recycle bin. This allows you to recover them if you change your mind.



## [Preferences](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/gui.html#id20)

![cbi](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/_images/preferences.png)The Preferences action allows you to change the way various aspects of calibre work. It has four variations, accessed by doing a right-click on the button.

> 1. **Preferences**: Allows you to change the way various aspects of calibre work. Clicking the button also performs this action.
> 2. **Run Welcome wizard**: Allows you to start the Welcome wizard which appeared the first time you started calibre.
> 3. **Get plugins to enhance calibre**: Opens a new window that shows plugins for calibre. These plugins are developed by third parties to extend calibre’s functionality.
> 4. **Restart in debug mode**: Allows you to enable a debugging mode that can assist the calibre developers in solving problems you encounter with the program. For most users this should remain disabled unless instructed by a developer to enable it.



## [Catalogs](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/gui.html#id21)

![_images/catalogs.png](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/_images/catalogs.png)

A *catalog* is a collection of books. calibre can manage two types of different catalogs:

> 1. **Library**: This is a collection of books stored in your calibre library on your computer.
> 2. **Device**: This is a collection of books stored in your e-book reader. It will be available when you connect the reader to your computer.

Many operations, such as adding books, deleting, viewing, etc., are context sensitive. So, for example, if you click the View button when you have the **Device** catalog selected, calibre will open the files on the device to view. If you have the **Library** catalog selected, files in your calibre library will be opened instead.



## [Search & sort](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/gui.html#id22)

![_images/search_sort.png](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/_images/search_sort.png)

The Search & Sort section allows you to perform several powerful actions on your book collections.

> - You can sort them by title, author, date, rating, etc. by clicking on the column titles. You can also sub-sort, i.e. sort on multiple columns. For example, if you click on the title column and then the author column, the book will be sorted by author and then all the entries for the same author will be sorted by title.
>
> - You can search for a particular book or set of books using the Search bar. More on that below.
>
> - You can quickly and conveniently edit metadata by selecting the entry you want changed in the list and pressing the E key.
>
> - You can perform [Actions](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/gui.html#actions) on sets of books. To select multiple books you can either:
>
>   > - Keep the Ctrl key pressed and click on the books you want selected.
>   > - Keep the Shift key pressed and click on the starting and ending book of a range of books you want selected.
>
> - You can configure which fields you want displayed by using the [Preferences](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/gui.html#configuration)dialog.



## [The search interface](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/gui.html#id23)

You can search all the metadata by entering search terms in the Search bar. Searches are case insensitive. For example:

```
Asimov Foundation format:lrf
```

This will match all books in your library that have `Asimov` and `Foundation` in their metadata and are available in the LRF format. Some more examples:

```
author:Asimov and not series:Foundation
title:"The Ring" or "This book is about a ring"
format:epub publisher:feedbooks.com
```

Searches are by default ‘contains’. An item matches if the search string appears anywhere in the indicated metadata. Two other kinds of searches are available: equality search and search using [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression).

Equality searches are indicated by prefixing the search string with an equals sign (=). For example, the query `tag:"=science"` will match “science”, but not “science fiction” or “hard science”. Regular expression searches are indicated by prefixing the search string with a tilde (~). Any [Python-compatible regular expression](https://docs.python.org/library/re.html) can be used. Note that backslashes used to escape special characters in regular expressions must be doubled because single backslashes will be removed during query parsing. For example, to match a literal parenthesis you must enter `\\(`. Regular expression searches are ‘contains’ searches unless the expression contains anchors.

Should you need to search for a string with a leading equals or tilde, prefix the string with a backslash.

Enclose search strings with quotes (“) if the string contains parenthesis or spaces. For example, to search for the tag `Science Fiction` you would need to search for `tag:"=science fiction"`. If you search for `tag:=science fiction` you will find all books with the tag ‘science’ and containing the word ‘fiction’ in any metadata.

You can build advanced search queries easily using the Advanced search dialog accessed by clicking the button ![sbi](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/_images/search_button.png).

Available fields for searching are: `tag, title, author, publisher, series, series_index, rating, cover, comments, format, identifiers, date, pubdate, search, size, vl` and custom columns. If a device is plugged in, the `ondevice` field becomes available, when searching the calibre library view. To find the search name (actually called the lookup name) for a custom column, hover your mouse over the column header in the library view.

The syntax for searching for dates is:

```
pubdate:>2000-1 Will find all books published after Jan, 2000
date:<=2000-1-3 Will find all books added to calibre before 3 Jan, 2000
pubdate:=2009 Will find all books published in 2009
```

If the date is ambiguous, the current locale is used for date comparison. For example, in an mm/dd/yyyy locale 2/1/2009 is interpreted as 1 Feb 2009. In a dd/mm/yyyy locale it is interpreted as 2 Jan 2009. Some special date strings are available. The string `today`translates to today’s date, whatever it is. The strings `yesterday` and `thismonth` (or the translated equivalent in the current language) also work. In addition, the string `daysago`(also translated) can be used to compare to a date some number of days ago. For example:

```
date:>10daysago
date:<=45daysago
```

To avoid potential problems with translated strings when using a non-English version of calibre, the strings `_today`, `_yesterday`, `_thismonth`, and `_daysago` are always available. They are not translated.

You can search for books that have a format of a certain size like this:

```
size:>1.1M Will find books with a format larger than 1.1MB
size:<=1K  Will find books with a format smaller than 1KB
```

Dates and numeric fields support the relational operators `=` (equals), `>` (greater than), `>=` (greater than or equal to), `<` (less than), `<=` (less than or equal to), and `!=` (not equal to). Rating fields are considered to be numeric. For example, the search `rating:>=3`will find all books rated 3 or higher.

You can search for the number of items in multiple-valued fields such as tags. These searches begin with the character `#`, then use the same syntax as numeric fields. For example, to find all books with more than 4 tags use `tags:#>4`. To find all books with exactly 10 tags use `tags:#=10`.

Series indices are searchable. For the standard series, the search name is ‘series_index’. For custom series columns, use the column search name followed by _index. For example, to search the indices for a custom series column named `#my_series`, you would use the search name `#my_series_index`. Series indices are numbers, so you can use the relational operators described above.

The special field `search` is used for saved searches. So if you save a search with the name “My spouse’s books” you can enter `search:"My spouse's books"` in the Search bar to reuse the saved search. More about saving searches below.

The special field `vl` is used to search for books in a Virtual library. For example, `vl:Read` will find all the books in the *Read* Virtual library. The search `vl:Read and vl:"Science Fiction"` will find all the books that are in both the *Read* and *Science Fiction* Virtual libraries. The value following `vl:` must be the name of a Virtual library. If the Virtual library name contains spaces then surround it with quotes.

You can search for the absence or presence of a field using the special “true” and “false” values. For example:

```
cover:false will give you all books without a cover
series:true will give you all books that belong to a series
comments:false will give you all books with an empty comment
format:false will give you all books with no actual files (empty records)
```

Yes/no custom columns are searchable. Searching for `false`, `empty`, or `blank` will find all books with undefined values in the column. Searching for `true` will find all books that do not have undefined values in the column. Searching for `yes` or `checked` will find all books with `Yes` in the column. Searching for `no` or `unchecked` will find all books with `No` in the column. Note that the words `yes`, `no`, `blank`, `empty`, `checked` and `unchecked`are translated; you can use either the current language’s equivalent word or the English word. The words `true` and `false` and the special values `_yes`, `_no`, and `_empty` are not translated.

Hierarchical items (e.g. A.B.C) use an extended syntax to match initial parts of the hierarchy. This is done by adding a period between the exact match indicator (=) and the text. For example, the query `tags:=.A` will find the tags A and A.B, but will not find the tags AA or AA.B. The query `tags:=.A.B` will find the tags A.B and A.B.C, but not the tag A.

Identifiers (e.g., ISBN, doi, lccn etc) also use an extended syntax. First, note that an identifier has the form `type:value`, as in `isbn:123456789`. The extended syntax permits you to specify independently which type and value to search for. Both the type and the value parts of the query can use equality, contains, or regular expression matches. Examples:

> - `identifiers:true` will find books with any identifier.
> - `identifiers:false` will find books with no identifier.
> - `identifiers:123` will search for books with any type having a value containing 123.
> - `identifiers:=123456789` will search for books with any type having a value equal to 123456789.
> - `identifiers:=isbn:` and `identifiers:isbn:true` will find books with a type equal to ISBN having any value
> - `identifiers:=isbn:false` will find books with no type equal to ISBN.
> - `identifiers:=isbn:123` will find books with a type equal to ISBN having a value containing 123.
> - `identifiers:=isbn:=123456789` will find books with a type equal to ISBN having a value equal to 123456789.
> - `identifiers:i:1` will find books with a type containing an i having a value containing a 1.

![_images/search.png](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/_images/search.png)

Advanced search dialog



## [Saving searches](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/gui.html#id24)

calibre allows you to save a frequently used search under a special name and then reuse that search with a single click. To do this, create your search either by typing it in the Search bar or using the Tag browser. Then type the name you would like to give to the search in the Saved Searches box next to the Search bar. Click the plus icon next to the saved searches box to save the search.

Now you can access your saved search in the Tag browser under “Searches”. A single click will allow you to reuse any arbitrarily complex search easily, without needing to re-create it.

## [Virtual libraries](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/gui.html#id25)

A Virtual library is a way to pretend that your calibre library has only a few books instead of its full collection. This is an excellent way to partition your large collection of books into smaller, manageable chunks. To learn how to create and use Virtual libraries, see the tutorial: [Virtual libraries](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/virtual_libraries.html#virtual-libraries).



## [Guessing metadata from file names](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/gui.html#id26)

Normally, calibre reads metadata from inside the book file. However, it can be configured to read metadata from the file name instead, via Preferences → Import/export → Adding books → Read metadata from file contents.

You can also control how metadata is read from the filename using regular expressions (see [All about using regular expressions in calibre](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/regexp.html)). In the Adding Books section of the configuration dialog, you can specify a regular expression that calibre will use to try and guess metadata from the names of e-book files that you add to the library. The default regular expression is:

```
title - author
```

that is, it assumes that all characters up to the first `-` are the title of the book and subsequent characters are the author of the book. For example, the filename:

```
Foundation and Earth - Isaac Asimov.txt
```

will be interpreted to have the title: Foundation and Earth and author: Isaac Asimov

Tip

If the filename does not contain the hyphen, the above regular expression will fail.



## [Book details](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/gui.html#id27)

![_images/book_details.png](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/_images/book_details.png)

The Book details display shows the cover and all the metadata for the currently selected book. It can be hidden via the Layout button in the lower right corner of the main calibre window. The author names shown in the Book details panel are click-able, they will by default take you to the Wikipedia page for the author. This can be customized by right clicking on the author name and selecting Manage this author.

Similarly, if you download metadata for the book, the Book details panel will automatically show you links pointing to the web pages for the book on amazon, worldcat, etc. from where the metadata was downloaded.

You can right click on individual e-book formats in the Book details panel to delete them, compare them to their original versions, save them to disk, open them with an external program, etc.

You can change the cover of the book by simply drag and dropping an image onto the Book details panel. If you wish to edit the cover image in an external program, simply right click on it and choose Open with.

You can also add e-book files to the current book by drag and dropping the files onto the Book details panel.

Double clicking the Book details panel will open it up in a separate popup window.

Finally, you can customize exactly what information is displayed in the Book details panel via Preferences → Interface → Look & feel → Book details.



## [Tag browser](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/gui.html#id28)

![_images/tag_browser.png](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/_images/tag_browser.png)

The Tag browser allows you to easily browse your collection by Author/Tags/Series/etc. If you click on any item in the Tag browser, for example the author name Isaac Asimov, then the list of books to the right is restricted to showing books by that author. You can click on category names as well. For example, clicking on “Series” will show you all books in any series.

The first click on an item will restrict the list of books to those that contain or match the item. Continuing the above example, clicking on Isaac Asimov will show books by that author. Clicking again on the item will change what is shown, depending on whether the item has children (see sub-categories and hierarchical items below). Continuing the Isaac Asimov example, clicking again on Isaac Asimov will restrict the list of books to those not by Isaac Asimov. A third click will remove the restriction, showing all books. If you hold down the Ctrl or Shift keys and click on multiple items, then restrictions based on multiple items are created. For example you could hold Ctrl and click on the tags History and Europe for finding books on European history. The Tag browser works by constructing search expressions that are automatically entered into the Search bar. Looking at what the Tag browser generates is a good way to learn how to construct basic search expressions.

Items in the Tag browser have their icons partially colored. The amount of color depends on the average rating of the books in that category. So for example if the books by Isaac Asimov have an average of four stars, the icon for Isaac Asimov in the Tag browser will be 4/5th colored. You can hover your mouse over the icon to see the average rating.

The outer-level items in the Tag browser, such as Authors and Series, are called categories. You can create your own categories, called User categories, which are useful for organizing items. For example, you can use the User categories editor (click the Configure button at the lower-left of the Tag browser and choose Manage authors, series, etc → User categories) to create a User category called `Favorite Authors`, then put the items for your favorites into the category. User categories can have sub-categories. For example, the User category `Favorites.Authors` is a sub-category of `Favorites`. You might also have `Favorites.Series`, in which case there will be two sub-categories under `Favorites`. Sub-categories can be created by right-clicking on a User category, choosing Add sub-category to…, and entering the sub-category name; or by using the User categories editor by entering names like the Favorites example above.

- You can search User categories in the same way as built-in categories, by clicking on them. There are four different searches cycled through by clicking:

  “everything matching an item in the category” indicated by a single green plus sign.“everything matching an item in the category or its sub-categories” indicated by two green plus signs.“everything not matching an item in the category” shown by a single red minus sign.“everything not matching an item in the category or its sub-categories” shown by two red minus signs.

It is also possible to create hierarchies inside some of the text categories such as tags, series, and custom columns. These hierarchies show with the small triangle, permitting the sub-items to be hidden. To use hierarchies of items in a category, you must first go to Preferences → Interface → Look & feel and enter the category name(s) into the “Categories with hierarchical items” field. Once this is done, items in that category that contain periods will be shown using the small triangle. For example, assume you create a custom column called “Genre” and indicate that it contains hierarchical items. Once done, items such as Mystery.Thriller and Mystery.English will display as Mystery with the small triangle next to it. Clicking on the triangle will show Thriller and English as sub-items. See [Managing subgroups of books, for example “genre”](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/sub_groups.html#subgroups-tutorial) for more information.

Hierarchical items (items with children) use the same four ‘click-on’ searches as User categories. Items that do not have children use two of the searches: “everything matching” and “everything not matching”.

You can drag and drop items in the Tag browser onto User categories to add them to that category. If the source is a User category, holding the shift key while dragging will move the item to the new category. You can also drag and drop books from the book list onto items in the Tag browser; dropping a book on an item causes that item to be automatically applied to the dropped books. For example, dragging a book onto Isaac Asimov will set the author of that book to Isaac Asimov. Dropping it onto the tag History will add the tag History to the book’s tags.

You can easily find any item in the Tag browser by clicking the search button at the lower-right corner. In addition, you can right click on any item and choose one of several operations. Some examples are to hide it, rename it, or open a “Manage x” dialog that allows you to manage items of that kind. For example, the “Manage Authors” dialog allows you to rename authors and control how their names are sorted.

You can control how items are sorted in the Tag browser via the Configure button at the lower-left of the Tag browser. You can choose to sort by name, average rating or popularity (popularity is the number of books with an item in your library; for example, the popularity of Isaac Asimov is the number of books in your library by Isaac Asimov).

## [Cover grid](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/gui.html#id29)

![_images/cover_grid.png](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/_images/cover_grid.png)

You can have calibre display a grid of book covers instead of a list of books, if you prefer to browse your collection by covers instead. The Cover grid is activated by clicking the Layout button in the bottom right corner of the main calibre window. You can customize the cover sizes and the background of the Cover grid via Preferences → Interface → Look & feel → Cover grid. You can even have calibre display any specified field under the covers, such as title or authors or rating or a custom column of your own devising.

## [Cover browser](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/gui.html#id30)

![_images/cover_browser.png](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/_images/cover_browser.png)

In addition to the Cover grid described above, you can also have calibre display covers in the single row. This is activated via the Layout button in the lower right corner of the main window. In Preferences → Interface → Look & feel → Cover browser you can change the number of covers displayed, and even have the Cover browser display itself in a separate popup window.

## [Quickview](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/gui.html#id31)

Sometimes you want to select a book and quickly get a list of books with the same value in some category (authors, tags, publisher, series, etc.) as the currently selected book, but without changing the current view of the library. You can do this with Quickview. Quickview opens either a second window or a panel in the book list showing the list of books matching the value of interest. For example, assume you want to see a list of all the books with the one or more of the authors of the currently-selected book. Click in the author cell you are interested in and press the ‘Q’ key or click the Quickview icon in the Layout section of the calibre window. A window or panel will open with all the authors for that book on the left, and all the books by the selected author on the right.

- Some example Quickview usages: quickly seeing what other books:

  have some tag(s) applied to the currently selected book,are in the same series as the current bookhave the same values in a custom column as the current bookare written by one of the same authors of the current bookshare values in a custom column

There are two choices for where the Quickview information appears:

> 1. It can open “undocked”: on top of the calibre window and will stay open until you explicitly close it.
> 2. It can open “docked”: as a panel in the book list section of the calibre main window.

You can move the window from docked to undocked as desired using the “Dock/Undock” button.

The Quickview panel can be left open permanently, in which case it follows movements on the book list. For example, if you click in the calibre library view on a category column (tags, series, publisher, authors, etc.) for a book, the Quickview window contents will change to show you in the left-hand side panel the values in that category for the selected book (e.g., the tags for that book). The first item in that list will be selected, and Quickview will show you on the right-hand side panel all the books in your library that use that value. Click on an different value in the left-hand panel to see the books with that different value.

Double-click on a book in the Quickview window to select that book in the library view. This will also change the items display in the QuickView window (the left-hand panel) to show the items in the newly-selected book.

`Shift-` or `Ctrl-` double-click on a book in the Quickview window to open the edit metadata dialog on that book in the calibre window. The edited book will be Quickview’ed when you close the edit metadata dialog.

You can see if a column can be Quickview’ed by hovering your mouse over the column heading and looking at the tooltip for that heading. You can also know by right-clicking on the column heading to see of the “Quickview” option is shown in the menu, in which case choosing that Quickview option is equivalent to pressing ‘Q’ in the current cell.

Options (in Preferences → Look & feel → Quickview):

> - Respect (or not) the current Virtual library. If checked then Quickview shows only books in the current Virtual library. Default: respect Virtual libraries
> - Change the Quickview window contents when the column is changed on the book list using the cursor keys. Default: don’t follow changes made with cursor keys
> - Change the column being “quickview’ed” when a cell in the Quickview window is double-clicked. Otherwise the book is changed but the column being examined is not. Default: change the column
> - Change the column being “quickview’ed” to the current column when the return key is pressed in the Quickview panel. Otherwise the book is changed but the column being examined is not. Default: change the column
> - Choose which columns are shown in the Quickview window/panel.



## [Jobs](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/gui.html#id32)

![_images/jobs.png](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/_images/jobs.png)

The Jobs panel shows the number of currently running jobs. Jobs are tasks that run in a separate process. They include converting e-books and talking to your reader device. You can click on the jobs panel to access the list of jobs. Once a job has completed you can see a detailed log from that job by double-clicking it in the list. This is useful to debug jobs that may not have completed successfully.

## [Keyboard shortcuts](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/gui.html#id33)

calibre has several keyboard shortcuts to save you time and mouse movement. These shortcuts are active in the book list view (when you’re not editing the details of a particular book), and most of them affect the title you have selected. The calibre E-book viewer has its own shortcuts which can be customised by clicking the Preferences button in the viewer.

Note

Note: The calibre keyboard shortcuts do not require a modifier key (Command, Option, Control, etc.), unless specifically noted. You only need to press the letter key, e.g. E to edit.

# Editing e-books

calibre has an integrated e-book editor that can be used to edit books in the EPUB and AZW3 (Kindle) formats. The editor shows you the HTML and CSS that is used internally inside the book files, with a live preview that updates as you make changes. It also contains various automated tools to perform common cleanup and fixing tasks.

You can use this editor by right clicking on any book in calibre and selecting Edit book.

## [Basic workflow](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id2)

Note

A video tour of the calibre editor is available [here](https://calibre-ebook.com/demo#tutorials).

When you first open a book with the Edit book tool, you will be presented with a list of files on the left. These are the individual HTML files, stylesheets, images, etc. that make up the content of the book. Simply double click on a file to start editing it. Note that if you want to do anything more sophisticated than making a few small tweaks, you will need to know [HTML Tutorial](http://html.net/tutorials/html/) and [CSS Tutorial](http://html.net/tutorials/css/).

As you make changes to the HTML or CSS in the editor, the changes will be previewed, live, in the preview panel to the right. When you are happy with how the changes you have made look, click the Save button or use File → Save to save your changes into the e-book.

One useful feature is Checkpoints. Before you embark on some ambitious set of edits, you can create a checkpoint. The checkpoint will preserve the current state of your book, then if in the future you decide you don’t like the changes you have made to you can go back to the state when you created the checkpoint. To create a checkpoint, use Edit → Create checkpoint. Checkpoints will also be automatically created for you whenever you run any automated tool like global search and replace. The checkpointing functionality is in addition to the normal undo/redo mechanism when editing individual files. Checkpoints are useful for when changes are spread over multiple files in the book.

That is the basic work flow for editing books – Open a file, make changes, preview and save. The rest of this manual will discuss the various tools and features present to allow you to perform specific tasks efficiently.

## [The File browser](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id3)

![The File browser](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/_images/files_browser.png)

The File browser gives you an overview of the various files inside the book you are editing. The files are arranged by category, with text (HTML) files at the top, followed by stylesheet (CSS) files, images and so on. Simply double click on a file to start editing it. Editing is supported for HTML, CSS and image files. The order of text files is the same order that they would be displayed in, if you were reading the book. All other files are arranged alphabetically.

By hovering your mouse over an entry, you can see its size, and also, at the bottom of the screen, the full path to the file inside the book. Note that files inside e-books are compressed, so the size of the final book is not the sum of the individual file sizes.

Many files have special meaning, in the book. These will typically have an icon next to their names, indicating the special meaning. For example, in the picture to the left, you can see that the files cover_image.jpg and titlepage.xhtml have the icon of a cover next to them, this indicates they are the book cover image and titlepage. Similarly, the content.opf file has a metadata icon next to it, indicating the book metadata is present in it and the toc.ncx file has a T icon next to it, indicating it is the Table of Contents.

You can perform many actions on individual files, by right clicking them.

### [Renaming files](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id4)

You can rename an individual file by right clicking it and selecting Rename. Renaming a file automatically updates all links and references to it throughout the book. So all you have to do is provide the new name, calibre will take care of the rest.

You can also bulk rename many files at once. This is useful if you want the files to have some simple name pattern. For example you might want to rename all the HTML files to have names Chapter-1.html, Chapter-2.html and so on. Select the files you want bulk renamed by holding down the Shift or Ctrl key and clicking the files. Then right click and select Bulk rename. Enter a prefix and what number you would like the automatic numbering to start at, click OK and you are done. The bulk rename dialog also lets you rename files by the order they appear in the book instead of the order you selected them in, useful, for instance to rename all images by the order they appear.

Finally, you can bulk change the file extension for all selected files. Select multiple files, as above, and right click and choose Change the file extension for the selected files.

### [Merging files](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id5)

Sometimes, you may want to merge two HTML files or two CSS files together. It can sometimes be useful to have everything in a single file. Be wary, though, putting a lot of content into a single file will cause performance problems when viewing the book in a typical e-book reader.

To merge multiple files together, select them by holding the Ctrl key and clicking on them (make sure you only select files of one type, either all HTML files or all CSS files and so on). Then right click and select merge. That’s all, calibre will merge the files, automatically taking care of migrating all links and references to the merged files. Note that merging files can sometimes cause text styling to change, since the individual files could have used different stylesheets.

### [Changing text file order](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id6)

You can re-arrange the order in which text (HTML) files are opened when reading the book by simply dragging and dropping them in the Files browser. For the technically inclined, this is called re-ordering the book spine. Note that you have to drop the items *between* other items, not on top of them, this can be a little fiddly until you get used to it.

### [Marking the cover](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id7)

E-books typically have a cover image. This image is indicated in the File browser by the icon of a brown book next to the image name. If you want to designate some other image as the cover, you can do so by right clicking on the file and choosing Mark as cover.

In addition, EPUB files has the concept of a *titlepage*. A title page is a HTML file that acts as the title page/cover for the book. You can mark an HTML file as the titlepage when editing EPUBs by right-clicking. Be careful that the file you mark contains only the cover information. If it contains other content, such as the first chapter, then that content will be lost if the user ever converts the EPUB file in calibre to another format. This is because when converting, calibre assumes that the marked title page contains only the cover and no other content.

### [Deleting files](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id8)

You can delete files by either right clicking on them or by selecting them and pressing the Delete key. Deleting a file removes all references to the file from the OPF file, saving you that chore. However, references in other places are not removed, you can use the Check Book tool to easily find and remove/replace them.

### [Exporting files](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id9)

You can export a file from inside the book to somewhere else on your computer. This is useful if you want to work on the file in isolation, with specialised tools. To do this, simply right click on the file and choose Export.

Once you are done working on the exported file, you can re-import it into the book, by right clicking on the file again and choosing Replace with file… which will allow you to replace the file in the book with the previously exported file.

You can also copy files between multiple editor instances. Select the files you want to copy in the File browser, then right click and choose, Copy selected files to another editor instance. Then, in the other editor instance, right click in the File browser and choose Paste file from other editor instance.

### [Adding new images/fonts/etc. or creating new blank files](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id10)

You can add a new image, font, stylesheet, etc. from your computer into the book by clicking File → New file. This lets you either import a file by clicking the Import resource file button or create a new blank HTML file or stylesheet by simply entering the file name into the box for the new file.

You can also import multiple files into the book at once using File->Import files into book.

### [Replacing files](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id11)

You can easily replace existing files in the book, by right clicking on the file and choosing replace. This will automatically update all links and references, in case the replacement file has a different name than the file being replaced.

### [Linking stylesheets to HTML files efficiently](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id12)

As a convenience, you can select multiple HTML files in the File browser, right click and choose Link stylesheets to have calibre automatically insert the <link> tags for those stylesheets into all the selected HTML files.

## [Search & replace](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id13)

Edit book has a very powerful search and replace interface that allows you to search and replace text in the current file, across all files and even in a marked region of the current file. You can search using a normal search or using regular expressions. To learn how to use regular expressions for advanced searching, see [All about using regular expressions in calibre](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/regexp.html#regexptutorial).

![The Edit book tool](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/_images/sr.png)

Start the search and replace via the Search → Find/replace menu entry (you must be editing an HTML or CSS file).

Type the text you want to find into the Find box and its replacement into the Replace box. You can the click the appropriate buttons to Find the next match, replace the current match and replace all matches.

Using the drop downs at the bottom of the box, you can have the search operate over the current file, all text files, all style files or all files. You can also choose the search mode to be a normal (string) search or a regular expression search.

You can count all the matches for a search expression via Search → Count all. The count will run over whatever files/regions you have selected in the dropdown box.

You can also go to a specific line in the currently open editor via Search → Go to line.

Note

Remember, to harness the full power of search and replace, you will need to use regular expressions. See [All about using regular expressions in calibre](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/regexp.html#regexptutorial).

### [Saved searches](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id14)

You can save frequently used search/replace expressions (including function mode expressions) and reuse them multiple times. To save a search simply right click in the Find box and select Save current search.

You can bring up the saved searches via Search → Saved searches. This will present you with a list of search and replace expressions that you can apply. You can even select multiple entries in the list by holding down the Ctrl Key while clicking so as to run multiple search and replace expressions in a single operation.

### [Function mode](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id15)

Function mode allows you to write arbitrarily powerful Python functions that are run on every Find/replace. You can do pretty much any text manipulation you like in function mode. For more information, see [Function mode for Search & replace in the Editor](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/function_mode.html).

### [Search ignoring HTML tags](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id16)

There is also a dedicated tool for searching for text, ignoring any HTML tags in between. For example, if the book has the HTML `Empahisis on a word.` you can search for `on a word` and it will be found even though there is an `` tag in the middle. Use this tool via the Search → Search ignoring HTML markupmenu item.

## [Automated tools](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id17)

Edit book has various tools to help with common tasks. These are accessed via the Toolsmenu.

### [Editing the Table of Contents](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id18)

There is a dedicated tool to ease editing of the Table of Contents. Launch it with Tools → Table of Contents → Edit Table of Contents.

![The Edit Table of Contents tool](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/_images/tocedit.png)

The Edit Table of Contents tool shows you the current Table of Contents (if any) on the left. Simply double click on any entry to change its text. You can also re-arrange entries by drag and drop or by using the buttons to the right.

For books that do not have a pre-existing Table of Contents, the tool gives you various options to auto-generate a Table of Contents from the text. You can generate from the headings in the document, from links, from individual files and so on.

You can edit individual entries by clicking on them and then clicking the Change the location this entry points to button. This will open up a mini-preview of the book, simply move the mouse cursor over the book view panel, and click where you want the entry to point to. A thick green line will show you the location. Click OK once you are happy with the location.

### [Checking the Book](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id19)

The Check Book tool searches your book for problems that could prevent it working as intended on actual reader devices. Activate it via Tools → Check Book.

![The Check Book tool](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/_images/check-book.png)

Any problems found are reported in a nice, easy to use list. Clicking any entry in the list shows you some help about that error as well as giving you the option to auto-fix that error, if the error can be fixed automatically. You can also double click the error to open the location of the error in an editor, so you can fix it yourself.

Some of the checks performed are:

> - Malformed HTML markup. Any HTML markup that does not parse as well-formed XML is reported. Correcting it will ensure that your markup works as intended in all contexts. calibre can also auto-fix these errors, but auto-fixing can sometimes have unexpected effects, so use with care. As always, a checkpoint is created before auto-fixing so you can easily revert all changes. Auto-fixing works by parsing the markup using the HTML5 algorithm, which is highly fault tolerant and then converting to well formed XML.
> - Malformed or unknown CSS styles. Any CSS that is not valid or that has properties not defined in the CSS 2.1 standard (plus a few from CSS 3) are reported. CSS is checked in all stylesheets, inline style attributes and <style> tags in HTML files.
> - Broken links. Links that point to files inside the book that are missing are reported.
> - Unreferenced files. Files in the book that are not referenced by any other file or are not in the spine are reported.
> - Various common problems in OPF files such as duplicate spine or manifest items, broken idrefs or meta cover tags, missing required sections and so on.
> - Various compatibility checks for known problems that can cause the book to malfunction on reader devices.

### [Adding a cover](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id20)

You can easily add a cover to the book via Tools → Add cover. This allows you to either choose an existing image in the book as the cover or import a new image into the book and make it the cover. When editing EPUB files, the HTML wrapper for the cover is automatically generated. If an existing cover in the book is found, it is replaced. The tool also automatically takes care of correctly marking the cover files as covers in the OPF.

### [Embedding referenced fonts](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id21)

Accessed via Tools → Embed reference fonts, this tool finds all fonts referenced in the book and if they are not already embedded, searches your computer for them and embeds them into the book, if found. Please make sure that you have the necessary copyrights for embedding commercially licensed fonts, before doing this.

### [Subsetting embedded fonts](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id22)

Accessed via Tools → Subset embedded fonts, this tool reduces all the fonts in the book to only contain glyphs for the text actually present in the book. This commonly reduces the size of the font files by ~ 50%. However, be aware that once the fonts are subset, if you add new text whose characters are not previously present in the subset font, the font will not work for the new text. So do this only as the last step in your workflow.

### [Smartening punctuation](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id23)

Convert plain text dashes, ellipsis, quotes, multiple hyphens, etc. into their typographically correct equivalents. Note that the algorithm can sometimes generate incorrect results, especially when single quotes at the start of contractions are involved. Accessed via Tools → Smarten punctuation.

### [Transforming CSS properties](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id24)

Create rules to transform the styling of the book. For example, create a rule to convert all red text to green or to double the font size of all text in the book or make text of a certain font family italic, etc.

Creating the rules is simple, the rules follow a natural language format, that looks like:

> - If the property *color* is *red* *change* it to *green*
> - If the property *font-size* is *any value* *multiply* the value by *2*

Accessed via Tools → Transform styles.

### [Removing unused CSS rules](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id25)

Remove all unused CSS rules from stylesheets and <style> tags. Some books created from production templates can have a large number of extra CSS rules that don’t match any actual content. These extra rules can slow down readers that need to process them all. Accessed via Tools → Remove unused CSS.

### [Fixing HTML](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id26)

This tool simply converts HTML that cannot be parsed as XML into well-formed XML. It is very common in e-books to have non-well-formed XML, so this tool simply automates the process of fixing such HTML. The tool works by parsing the HTML using the HTML5 algorithm (the algorithm used in all modern browsers) and then converting the result into XML. Be aware that auto-fixing can sometimes have counter-intuitive results. If you prefer, you can use the Check Book tool discussed above to find and manually correct problems in the HTML. Accessed via Tools → Fix HTML.

### [Beautifying files](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id27)

This tool is used to auto-format all HTML and CSS files so that they “look pretty”. The code is auto-indented so that it lines up nicely, blank lines are inserted where appropriate and so on. Note that beautifying also auto-fixes broken HTML/CSS. Therefore, if you don’t want any auto-fixing to be performed, first use the Check Book tool to correct all problems and only then run beautify. Accessed via Tools → Beautify all files.

Note

In HTML any text can have significant whitespace, via the CSS white-space directive. Therefore, beautification could potentially change the rendering of the HTML. To avoid this as far as possible, the beautify algorithm only beautifies block level tags that contain other block level tags. So, for example, text inside a <p> tag will not have its whitespace changed. But a <body> tag that contains only other <p> and <div> tags will be beautified. This can sometimes mean that a particular file will not be affected by beautify as it has no suitable block level tags. In such cases you can try different beautification tools, that are less careful, for example: [HTML Tidy](https://infohound.net/tidy/).

### [Inserting an inline Table of Contents](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id28)

Normally in e-books, the Table of Contents is separate from the main text and is typically accessed via a special Table of Contents button/menu in the e-book reading device. You can also have calibre automatically generate an *inline* Table of Contents that becomes part of the text of the book. It is generated based on the currently defined Table of Contents.

If you use this tool multiple times, each invocation will cause the previously created inline Table of Contents to be replaced. The tool can be accessed via Tools → Table of Contents → Insert inline Table of Contents.

### [Setting Semantics](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id29)

This tool is used to set *semantics* in EPUB files. Semantics are simply, links in the OPF file that identify certain locations in the book as having special meaning. You can use them to identify the foreword, dedication, cover, table of contents, etc. Simply choose the type of semantic information you want to specify and then select the location in the book the link should point to. This tool can be accessed via Tools → Set semantics.

### [Filtering style information](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id30)

This tool can be used to easily remove specified CSS style properties from the entire book. You can tell it what properties you want removed, for example, `color, background-color, line-height` and it will remove them from everywhere they occur — stylesheets, `` tags and inline `style` attributes. After removing the style information, a summary of all the changes made is displayed so you can see exactly what was changed. The tool can be accessed via Tools → Filter style information.

### [Upgrading the book’s internals](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id31)

This tool can be used to upgrade the book’s internals, if possible. For instance it will upgrade EPUB 2 books to EPUB 3 books. The tool can be accessed via Upgrade book internals.



## [Checkpoints](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id32)

Checkpoints are a way to mark the current state of the book as “special”. You can then go on to do whatever changes you want to the book and if you don’t like the results, return to the checkpointed state. Checkpoints are automatically created every time you run any of the automated tools described in the previous section.

You can create a checkpoint via Edit → Create checkpoint. And go back to a previous checkpoint with Edit → Revert to …

The check pointing functionality is in addition to the normal Undo/redo mechanism when editing individual files. Checkpoints are particularly useful for when changes are spread over multiple files in the book or when you wish to be able to revert a large group of related changes as a whole.

You can see a list of available checkpoints via View → Checkpoints. You can compare the current state of the book to a specified checkpoint using the [Comparing e-books](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/diff.html#diff) tool – by selecting the checkpoint of interest and clicking the Compare button. The Revert tobutton restores the book to the selected checkpoint, undoing all changes since that checkpoint was created.

## [The Live preview panel](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id33)

![The Live preview Panel](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/_images/live-preview.png)

The File preview gives you an overview of the various files inside The live preview panel shows you the changes you are making live (with a second or two of delay). As you edit HTML or CSS files, the preview panel is updated automatically to reflect your changes. As you move the cursor around in the editor, the preview panel will track its location, showing you the corresponding location in the book. Clicking in the preview panel, will cause the cursor in the editor to be positioned over the element you clicked. If you click a link pointing to another file in the book, that file will be opened in the edit and the preview panel, automatically.

You can turn off the automatic syncing of position and live preview of changes – by buttons under the preview panel. The live update of the preview panel only happens when you are not actively typing in the editor, so as not to be distracting or slow you down, waiting for the preview to render.

The preview panel shows you how the text will look when viewed. However, the preview panel is not a substitute for actually testing your book an actual reader device. It is both more, and less capable than an actual reader. It will tolerate errors and sloppy markup much better than most reader devices. It will also not show you page margins, page breaks and embedded fonts that use font name aliasing. Use the preview panel while you are working on the book, but once you are done, review it in an actual reader device or software emulator.

Note

The preview panel does not support embedded fonts if the name of the font inside the font file does not match the name in the CSS @font-face rule. You can use the Check Book tool to quickly find and fix any such problem fonts.

### [Splitting HTML files](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id34)

One, perhaps non-obvious, use of the preview panel is to split long HTML files. While viewing the file you want to split, click the Split mode button under the preview panel ![spmb](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/_images/split-button.png). Then simply move your mouse to the place where you want to split the file and click. A thick green line will show you exactly where the split will happen as you move your mouse. Once you have found the location you want, simply click and the split will be performed.

Splitting the file will automatically update all links and references that pointed into the bottom half of the file and will open the newly split file in an editor.

You can also split a single HTML file at multiple locations automatically, by right clicking inside the file in the editor and choosing Split at multiple locations. This will allow you to easily split a large file at all heading tags or all tags having a certain class and so on.

## [The Live CSS panel](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id35)

![The Live CSS Panel](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/_images/live_css.png)

The Live CSS panel shows you all the style rules that apply to the tag you are currently editing. The name of tag, along with its line number in the editor are displayed, followed by a list of matching style rules.

It is a great way to quickly see which style rules apply to any tag. The view also has clickable links (in blue), which take you directly to the location where the style was defined, in case you wish to make any changes to the style rules. Style rules that apply directly to the tag, as well as rules that are inherited from parent tags are shown.

The panel also shows you what the finally calculated styles for the tag are. Properties in the list that are superseded by higher priority rules are shown with a line through them.

You can enable the Live CSS panel via View → Live CSS.

## [Miscellaneous tools](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id36)

There are a few more tools that can be useful while you edit the book.

### [The Table of Contents view](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id37)

The Table of Contents view shows you the current table of contents in the book. Double clicking on any entry opens the place that entry points to in an editor. You can right click to edit the Table of Contents, refresh the view or expand/collapse all items. Access this view via View → Table of Contents.

### [Checking the spelling of words in the book](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id38)

You can run a spelling checker via Tools → Check spelling.

![The Check Spelling tool](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/_images/edit-book-spell.png)

Words are shown with the number of times they occur in the book and the language the word belongs to. Language information is taken from the books metadata and from `lang` attributes in the HTML files. This allows the spell checker to work well even with books that contain text in multiple languages. For example, in the following HTML extract, the word color will be checked using American English and the word colour using British English:

```
<div lang="en_US">color <span lang="en_GB">colour</span></div>
```

Note

You can double click a word to highlight the next occurrence of that word in the editor. This is useful if you wish to manually edit the word, or see what context it is in.

To change a word, simply double click one of the suggested alternative spellings on the right, or type in your own corrected spelling and click the Change selected word to button. This will replace all occurrences of the word in the book. You can also right click on a word in the main word list to change the word conveniently from the right click menu.

You can have the spelling checker ignore a word for the current session by clicking the Ignore button. You can also add a word to the user dictionary by clicking the Add to dictionary button. The spelling checker supports multiple user dictionaries, so you can select the dictionary you want the word added to.

You can also have the spelling checker display all the words in your book, not just the incorrectly spelled ones. This is useful to see what words are most common in your book and to run a simple search and replace on individual words.

Note

If you make any changes to the book by editing files while the spell check tool is open, you should click the Refresh button in the Spell check tool. If you do not do this and continue to use the Spell check tool, you could lose the changes you have made in the editor.

#### Adding new dictionaries

The spelling checker comes with builtin dictionaries for the English and Spanish languages. You can install your own dictionaries via Preferences → Editor → Manage spelling dictionaries. The spell checker can use dictionaries from the LibreOffice program (in the .oxt format). You can download these dictionaries from [The LibreOffice Extensions repository](https://extensions.libreoffice.org/extension-center?getCategories=Dictionary&getCompatibility=any&sort_on=positive_ratings).

### [Inserting special characters](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id39)

You can insert characters that are difficult to type by using the Edit → Insert special character tool. This shows you all unicode characters, simply click on the character you want to type. If you hold Ctrl while clicking, the window will close itself after inserting the selected character. This tool can be used to insert special characters into the main text or into any other area of the user interface, such as the Search and replace tool.

Because there are a lot of characters, you can define your own Favorite characters, that will be shown first. Simply right click on a character to mark it as favorite. You can also right click on a character in favorites to remove it from favorites. Finally, you can re-arrange the order of characters in favorites by clicking the Re-arrange favorites button and then drag and dropping the characters in favorites around.

You can also directly type in special characters using the keyboard. To do this, you type the unicode code for the character (in hexadecimal) and then press the Alt+X key which will convert the previously typed code into the corresponding character. For example, to type ÿ you would type ff and then Alt+X. To type a non-breaking space you would use a0 and then Alt+X, to type the horizontal ellipsis you would use 2026 and Alt+X and so on.

Finally, you can type in special characters by using HTML named entities. For example, typing &nbsp; will be replaced by a non breaking space when you type the semi-colon. The replacement happens only when typing the semi-colon.

### [The code inspector view](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id40)

This view shows you the HTML coding and CSS that applies to the current element of interest. You open it by right clicking a location in the preview panel and choosing Inspect. It allows you to see the HTML coding for that element and more importantly, the CSS styles that apply to it. You can even dynamically edit the styles and see what effect your changes have instantly. Note that editing the styles does not actually make changes to the book contents, it only allows for quick experimentation. The ability to live edit inside the Inspector is under development.

### [Checking external links](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id41)

You can use this tool to check all links in your book that point to external websites. The tool will try to visit every externally linked website, and if the visit fails, it will report all broken links in a convenient format for you to fix.

### [Downloading external resources](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id42)

You can use this tool to automatically download any images/stylesheets/etc. in the book that are not bundled with the book (i.e. they have URLs pointing to a location on the internet). The tool will find all such resources and automatically download them, add them to the book and replace all references to them to use the downloaded files.

### [Arranging files into folders by type](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id43)

Often when editing EPUB files that you get from somewhere, you will find that the files inside the EPUB are arranged haphazardly, in different sub-folders. This tool allows you to automatically move all files into sub-folders based on their types. Access it via Tools → Arrange into folders. Note that this tool only changes how the files are arranged inside the EPUB, it does not change how they are displayed in the File browser.

### [Importing files in other e-book formats as EPUB](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id44)

The editor includes the ability to import files in some other e-book formats directly as a new EPUB, without going through a full conversion. This is particularly useful to directly create EPUB files from your own hand-edited HTML files. You can do this via File → Import an HTML or DOCX file as a new book.

### [The Reports tool](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id45)

The editor includes a nice *Reports* tool (via Tools → Reports) that shows summaries of the files, images, links, words, characters and styles used in the book. Every line in the report is hot-linked. Double clicking a line jumps to the place in the book where that item is used or defined (as appropriate). For example, in the Links view, you can double click entries the Source column to jump to where the link is defined and entries in the Target column to jump to where the link points.

![The Reports tool](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/_images/reports-ss.png)

## [Special features in the code editor](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id46)

The calibre HTML editor is very powerful. It has many features that make editing of HTML (and CSS) easier.

### [Syntax highlighting](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id47)

The HTML editor has very sophisticated syntax highlighting. Features include:

> - The text inside bold, italic and heading tags is made bold/italic
> - As you move your cursor through the HTML, the matching HTML tags are highlighted, and you can jump to the opening or closing tag with the keyboard shortcuts Ctrl+{ and Ctrl+}. Similarly, you can select the contents of a tag with Ctrl+Alt+T.
> - Invalid HTML is highlighted with a red underline
> - Spelling errors in the text inside HTML tags and attributes such as title are highlighted. The spell checking is language aware, based on the value of the lang attribute of the current tag and the overall book language.
> - CSS embedded inside `` tags is highlighted
> - Special characters that can be hard to distinguish such as non-breaking spaces, different types of hyphens, etc. are highlighted.
> - Links to other files in `` tags, `` and `` tags all have the filenames highlighted. If the filename they point to does not exist, the filename is marked with a red underline.

### [Context sensitive help](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id48)

You can right click on an HTML tag name or a CSS property name to get help for that tag or property.

You can also hold down the Ctrl key and click on any filename inside a link tag to open that file in the editor automatically.



### [Auto-complete](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html#id49)

When editing an e-book, one of the most tedious tasks is creating links to other files inside the book, or to CSS stylesheets,
